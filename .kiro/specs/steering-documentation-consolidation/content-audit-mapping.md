## Identified Duplicate Content

### Major Duplication: fix-root-problems.md vs fix-root-problems-not-tests.md

**Overlapping Content (~80% duplication):**
- Core Principle: Both emphasize fixing implementation rather than changing tests
- Anti-Patterns: Both warn against disabling functionality to make tests pass
- Enforcement: Both have similar enforcement guidelines
- Philosophy: Both share the same fundamental approach to test-driven problem solving

**Unique Content in fix-root-problems.md:**
- 5 specific questions to ask when tests fail
- Examples of root problem fixing (status field serialization, API signature changes)
- Red flags that indicate masking problems
- Exception cases when test changes are appropriate

**Unique Content in fix-root-problems-not-tests.md:**
- Specific focus on readiness evaluator issues
- Technical details about serialization problems (JSON.parse(JSON.stringify()) stripping functions)
- Specific guidance about Alchemy integration issues
- Concrete examples with waitForReady parameter

**Consolidation Strategy:** Merge both documents into a single comprehensive section in `development-standards.md` that combines the general principles from `fix-root-problems.md` with the specific technical examples from `fix-root-problems-not-tests.md`.

### Minor Content Overlaps

**Testing Philosophy Overlap:**
- `typescript-type-safety-testing.md`, `status-builder-patterns.md`, and `integration-testing-setup.md` all contain testing guidance but focus on different aspects (type safety, status builders, integration setup respectively)
- **Resolution:** Keep separate sections in `testing-guidelines.md` as they address different testing concerns

**Development Process Overlap:**
- `context-first-development.md` and `production-quality-standards.md` both discuss development methodology but from different angles (investigation process vs quality standards)
- **Resolution:** Combine into comprehensive development standards covering both aspects

**Architecture Information Overlap:**
- `codebase-structure.md` and `resource-graph-transpilation-hydration.md` both contain architecture information but at different levels (codebase organization vs system pipeline)
- **Resolution:** Combine into comprehensive architecture guide covering both structural and system architecture

## Cross-Reference Strategy

### Internal References to Create
1. **development-standards.md** â†’ **testing-guidelines.md**: Reference testing approaches when discussing problem-solving methodology
2. **testing-guidelines.md** â†’ **architecture-guide.md**: Reference architecture concepts when explaining integration testing and system behavior
3. **architecture-guide.md** â†’ **tooling-requirements.md**: Reference tooling setup when discussing development environment and build processes
4. **tooling-requirements.md** â†’ **testing-guidelines.md**: Reference testing setup when discussing integration testing cluster requirements

### Content Organization Strategy
1. **Avoid Duplication**: When concepts appear in multiple contexts, maintain primary definition in one document and reference from others
2. **Logical Flow**: Ensure documents can be read independently but also support sequential reading
3. **Strategic Referencing**: Use markdown links to connect related concepts across documents

## Implementation Notes

### Merge Priority
1. **High Priority**: fix-root-problems.md + fix-root-problems-not-tests.md (significant duplication)
2. **Medium Priority**: Ensure all unique content is preserved during consolidation
3. **Low Priority**: Optimize cross-references and document flow

### Quality Assurance
- Create backup of all original documents before consolidation
- Document consolidation mapping for reference
- Validate that merged content maintains original meaning
- Test that cross-references work correctly
- Ensure no broken or circular references

This audit ensures that the consolidation process will preserve all important information while eliminating redundancy and improving the overall organization and usability of the steering documentation.
