# Design Document

## Overview

This design consolidates 10 steering documents into 4 focused documents that eliminate redundancy while preserving all important information. The consolidation groups related concepts together and creates a logical hierarchy that makes guidance easier to find and follow.

## Architecture

### Current State Analysis

**Existing Documents (10 files):**
1. `typescript-type-safety-testing.md` - Testing patterns and type safety
2. `status-builder-patterns.md` - Specific patterns for status builders
3. `resource-graph-transpilation-hydration.md` - Complex system architecture
4. `production-quality-standards.md` - Code quality and implementation standards
5. `integration-testing-setup.md` - Test environment setup
6. `fix-root-problems.md` - Problem-solving philosophy
7. `fix-root-problems-not-tests.md` - Specific anti-pattern (duplicate content)
8. `context-first-development.md` - Development methodology
9. `codebase-structure.md` - Project organization
10. `build-and-test-tooling.md` - Tooling requirements

**Identified Redundancies:**
- `fix-root-problems.md` and `fix-root-problems-not-tests.md` have 80% overlapping content
- Testing guidance is scattered across 3 files (typescript-type-safety, integration-testing-setup, status-builder-patterns)
- Development philosophy appears in multiple files (context-first, production-quality, fix-root-problems)
- Architecture information is split between codebase-structure and resource-graph-transpilation

### Target State Design

**Consolidated Documents (4 files):**

1. **`development-standards.md`** - Core development practices and philosophy
2. **`testing-guidelines.md`** - Comprehensive testing guidance
3. **`architecture-guide.md`** - System architecture and codebase structure
4. **`tooling-requirements.md`** - Build tools and environment setup

## Components and Interfaces

```

### Document 4: Tooling Requirements (`tooling-requirements.md`)

**Purpose:** Build tools, environment setup, and development toolchain.

**Consolidated Content:**
- Build and test tooling (from `build-and-test-tooling.md`)
- Integration testing environment setup
- CI/CD requirements
- Development environment standards

**Structure:**
```markdown
# Tooling Requirements

## Package Manager
- Bun requirements
- Migration guidelines
- CI/CD integration

## Development Environment
- Required tools
- Setup procedures
- Configuration standards

```

## Data Models

### Content Mapping Matrix

| Original Document | Target Document | Content Sections |
|------------------|----------------|------------------|
| `production-quality-standards.md` | `development-standards.md` | Core principles, implementation standards, quality gates |
| `context-first-development.md` | `development-standards.md` | Investigation process, context-first methodology |
| `fix-root-problems.md` | `development-standards.md` | Problem-solving philosophy, enforcement |
| `fix-root-problems-not-tests.md` | `development-standards.md` | Specific anti-patterns (merged with above) |
| `typescript-type-safety-testing.md` | `testing-guidelines.md` | Type safety rules, testing patterns |
| `status-builder-patterns.md` | `testing-guidelines.md` | Supported patterns, migration guide |
| `integration-testing-setup.md` | `testing-guidelines.md` | Cluster setup, troubleshooting |
| `resource-graph-transpilation-hydration.md` | `architecture-guide.md` | System pipeline, debugging guidelines |
| `codebase-structure.md` | `architecture-guide.md` | Directory structure, development guidelines |
| `build-and-test-tooling.md` | `tooling-requirements.md` | Bun requirements, CI/CD, installation |

### Cross-Reference Strategy

**Internal References:** Use markdown links to connect related concepts across documents:
- `development-standards.md` references testing approaches in `testing-guidelines.md`
- `testing-guidelines.md` references architecture concepts in `architecture-guide.md`
- `architecture-guide.md` references tooling setup in `tooling-requirements.md`

**Avoid Duplication:** When concepts appear in multiple contexts, maintain the primary definition in one document and reference it from others.

## Error Handling

### Content Loss Prevention

1. **Comprehensive Content Audit:** Before consolidation, create a checklist of all unique rules, patterns, and guidelines
2. **Diff Validation:** After consolidation, verify that all original content has been preserved or intentionally merged
3. **Cross-Reference Verification:** Ensure all internal references remain valid after restructuring

### Migration Safety

1. **Backup Strategy:** Keep original files until consolidation is validated
2. **Gradual Migration:** Implement consolidation in stages to allow for validation
3. **Rollback Plan:** Maintain ability to restore original structure if issues are discovered

## Testing Strategy

### Content Completeness Testing

1. **Rule Coverage:** Verify all original rules and guidelines are present in consolidated documents
2. **Example Preservation:** Ensure all code examples and anti-patterns are maintained
3. **Cross-Reference Validation:** Test that all internal links work correctly

### Usability Testing

1. **Developer Workflow:** Test that common development scenarios can be resolved using consolidated docs
2. **Information Findability:** Verify that guidance can be located efficiently
3. **Logical Flow:** Ensure document organization supports natural reading patterns

### Maintenance Testing

1. **Update Scenarios:** Test that changes can be made without creating inconsistencies
2. **Reference Integrity:** Verify that cross-references remain accurate during updates
3. **Duplication Detection:** Implement checks to prevent re-introduction of redundant content
