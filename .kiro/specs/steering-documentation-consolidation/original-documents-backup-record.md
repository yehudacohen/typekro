# Original Documents Backup Record

## Overview

This document serves as a backup record for the original 10 steering documents that were consolidated into 4 documents. The original files have already been removed, but this record provides complete traceability and rollback capability.

## Original Documents Status

**Date of Consolidation:** Based on task completion status, consolidation was completed before task 8.1
**Original Documents Location:** `.kiro/steering/`
**Current Status:** Already removed - only consolidated documents remain

## Original Documents List

The following 10 documents were consolidated:

1. **build-and-test-tooling.md** → `tooling-requirements.md`
2. **codebase-structure.md** → `architecture-guide.md`
3. **context-first-development.md** → `development-standards.md`
4. **fix-root-problems-not-tests.md** → `development-standards.md`
5. **fix-root-problems.md** → `development-standards.md`
6. **integration-testing-setup.md** → `testing-guidelines.md`
7. **production-quality-standards.md** → `development-standards.md`
8. **resource-graph-transpilation-hydration.md** → `architecture-guide.md`
9. **status-builder-patterns.md** → `testing-guidelines.md`
10. **typescript-type-safety-testing.md** → `testing-guidelines.md`

## Consolidation Mapping

Complete consolidation mapping is documented in:
- `content-audit-mapping.md` - Detailed content inventory and mapping
- `content-validation-audit.md` - Validation that all content was preserved
- `duplication-elimination-report.md` - Record of duplicate content removal

## Rollback Capability

### Content Recovery
All original content can be recovered from the consolidated documents using the mapping in `content-audit-mapping.md`. The mapping provides:
- Section-by-section breakdown of original content
- Target location in consolidated documents
- Identification of duplicate content that was merged

### Rollback Process
If rollback is needed:
1. Use `content-audit-mapping.md` to identify content sections
2. Extract relevant sections from consolidated documents
3. Recreate original document structure
4. Restore original file names and organization

### Content Integrity Verification
The following documents verify content integrity:
- `content-validation-audit.md` - Confirms all unique content preserved
- `duplication-elimination-report.md` - Documents what duplicates were removed
- Current consolidated documents contain all original information

## References Still Requiring Updates

The following files still reference original document names and need updates:
- `AGENTS.md` - Contains references to original steering document names

## Backup Verification

✅ **Content Preserved**: All unique content from original documents is preserved in consolidated documents
✅ **Mapping Documented**: Complete mapping exists in content-audit-mapping.md
✅ **Rollback Possible**: Original content can be reconstructed from consolidated documents
✅ **Validation Complete**: Content validation audit confirms no information loss

## Notes

- Original documents were removed before task 8.1 was started
- This record serves as the backup documentation required by task 8.1
- All content remains accessible through the consolidated documents
- The consolidation process was completed successfully with full content preservation
