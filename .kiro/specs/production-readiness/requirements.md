# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec focuses on preparing the TypeKro codebase for production readiness by implementing professional logging, code quality improvements, comprehensive documentation, and contributor guidelines. The goal is to transform TypeKro from a development-stage library into a production-ready open source project that follows industry best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Professional Logging System

**User Story:** As a developer using TypeKro in production, I want structured, configurable logging so that I can monitor, debug, and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the codebase is audited THEN all console.log, console.warn, and console.error statements SHALL be identified and catalogued
2. WHEN a logging framework is selected THEN it SHALL be Pino for its performance and structured logging capabilities
3. WHEN console statements are replaced THEN each SHALL be evaluated for necessity, appropriate log level, and message clarity
4. WHEN logging is implemented THEN it SHALL support configurable log levels (trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal)
5. WHEN logging is implemented THEN it SHALL produce structured JSON output suitable for production log aggregation
6. WHEN logging is implemented THEN it SHALL include contextual information (timestamps, request IDs, resource names)
7. WHEN the logging migration is complete THEN no console.* statements SHALL remain in the production codebase

### Requirement 2: Code Quality and Linting

**User Story:** As a maintainer of TypeKro, I want comprehensive code quality checks so that the codebase maintains high standards and consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `bun run lint` is executed THEN it SHALL complete without any errors
2. WHEN linting warnings are generated THEN each SHALL be reviewed and either fixed or explicitly justified
3. WHEN code quality issues are identified THEN they SHALL be categorized by severity and impact
4. WHEN linting rules are applied THEN they SHALL enforce consistent code style, import organization, and TypeScript best practices
5. WHEN the linting process is complete THEN the codebase SHALL have zero linting errors and minimal justified warnings

### Requirement 3: Comprehensive README

**User Story:** As a new user of TypeKro, I want a clear, comprehensive README so that I can quickly understand the library's purpose, capabilities, and how to get started.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the README is updated THEN it SHALL include up-to-date installation and quick start examples
2. WHEN the README describes functionality THEN it SHALL explain the underlying mechanisms (factory pattern, resource graphs, CEL expressions)
3. WHEN the README shows examples THEN they SHALL demonstrate real-world usage patterns with current API
4. WHEN the README describes architecture THEN it SHALL explain the codebase structure and key concepts
5. WHEN the README is complete THEN it SHALL include links to comprehensive documentation
6. WHEN examples are provided THEN they SHALL be tested and verified to work with the current codebase

### Requirement 4: Modern Documentation Site

**User Story:** As a developer evaluating or using TypeKro, I want comprehensive, searchable documentation so that I can understand all features and implementation details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a documentation framework is selected THEN it SHALL be a modern solution (VitePress, Docusaurus, or similar)
2. WHEN the documentation site is built THEN it SHALL include API reference, guides, examples, and architectural explanations
3. WHEN the documentation is structured THEN it SHALL have clear navigation, search functionality, and responsive design
4. WHEN API documentation is generated THEN it SHALL be automatically derived from TypeScript types and JSDoc comments
5. WHEN examples are included THEN they SHALL be executable and demonstrate real-world usage patterns
6. WHEN the documentation is deployed THEN it SHALL be accessible via a public URL with proper hosting
7. WHEN the documentation is complete THEN it SHALL cover all public APIs, factory functions, and core concepts

### Requirement 5: Contributing Guidelines

**User Story:** As a potential contributor to TypeKro, I want clear contributing guidelines so that I can effectively add new features and factory functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CONTRIBUTING.md is created THEN it SHALL include setup instructions, development workflow, and coding standards
2. WHEN factory contribution guidelines are provided THEN they SHALL include step-by-step examples for adding new Kubernetes resources
3. WHEN contribution examples are shown THEN they SHALL demonstrate the complete process from factory creation to testing
4. WHEN coding standards are documented THEN they SHALL reference the established patterns and architectural decisions
5. WHEN the contribution guide is complete THEN it SHALL include PR guidelines, testing requirements, and review process
6. WHEN factory examples are provided THEN they SHALL show both simple and complex resource factory implementations

### Requirement 6: Production Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a maintainer of TypeKro, I want production-ready infrastructure so that the project can be reliably built, tested, and deployed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CI/CD pipelines are reviewed THEN they SHALL use bun consistently and include all quality checks
2. WHEN package.json is audited THEN it SHALL have appropriate metadata, keywords, and repository information
3. WHEN dependencies are reviewed THEN they SHALL be up-to-date, secure, and necessary
4. WHEN build processes are validated THEN they SHALL produce optimized, tree-shakeable outputs
5. WHEN release processes are defined THEN they SHALL include automated versioning, changelog generation, and npm publishing
6. WHEN security is considered THEN the project SHALL have vulnerability scanning and dependency auditing

### Requirement 7: Performance and Bundle Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer using TypeKro in my application, I want optimized bundle sizes so that my application remains performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN bundle analysis is performed THEN it SHALL identify opportunities for tree-shaking and code splitting
2. WHEN imports are optimized THEN they SHALL support selective importing of factory functions
3. WHEN dependencies are reviewed THEN unnecessary or oversized dependencies SHALL be identified and addressed
4. WHEN build outputs are analyzed THEN they SHALL be optimized for both CommonJS and ESM consumption
5. WHEN performance is measured THEN factory creation and serialization SHALL meet acceptable benchmarks

### Requirement 8: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a maintainer of TypeKro, I want comprehensive test coverage so that production deployments are reliable and regressions are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test coverage is measured THEN it SHALL meet or exceed 90% for core functionality
2. WHEN integration tests are reviewed THEN they SHALL cover real-world usage scenarios
3. WHEN test reliability is assessed THEN flaky tests SHALL be identified and fixed
4. WHEN test performance is measured THEN the full test suite SHALL complete in reasonable time
5. WHEN test documentation is created THEN it SHALL explain testing patterns and how to add new tests
