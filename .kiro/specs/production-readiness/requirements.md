# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec focuses on preparing the TypeKro codebase for production readiness by completing unfinished core functionality, implementing code quality improvements, comprehensive documentation, and contributor guidelines. The goal is to transform TypeKro from a development-stage library into a production-ready open source project that follows industry best practices.

**Current Status**: Professional logging has been completed with a sophisticated Pino-based system. The primary focus is now on completing core functionality gaps including cluster resource querying, health checking, CEL evaluation, and alchemy integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Professional Logging System âœ… COMPLETED

**User Story:** As a developer using TypeKro in production, I want structured, configurable logging so that I can monitor, debug, and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. âœ… WHEN the codebase is audited THEN all console.log, console.warn, and console.error statements SHALL be identified and catalogued
2. âœ… WHEN a logging framework is selected THEN it SHALL be Pino for its performance and structured logging capabilities
3. âœ… WHEN console statements are replaced THEN each SHALL be evaluated for necessity, appropriate log level, and message clarity
4. âœ… WHEN logging is implemented THEN it SHALL support configurable log levels (trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal)
5. âœ… WHEN logging is implemented THEN it SHALL produce structured JSON output suitable for production log aggregation
6. âœ… WHEN logging is implemented THEN it SHALL include contextual information (timestamps, request IDs, resource names)
7. âœ… WHEN the logging migration is complete THEN no console.* statements SHALL remain in the production codebase
8. ðŸ”„ WHEN log levels are reviewed THEN each log statement SHALL use the appropriate level for its purpose and context

**Status**: This requirement is mostly implemented with a sophisticated Pino-based logging system. **Remaining work**: Review all log levels to ensure they are appropriately set for production use.
