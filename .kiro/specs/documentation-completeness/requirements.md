# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec focuses on completing TypeKro's documentation site to production readiness by implementing comprehensive guides, API references, examples, and interactive features. The goal is to transform TypeKro from having incomplete documentation (11 out of 50+ configured pages) into a professional, production-ready documentation site that serves users across all skill levels and use cases.

**Current Status**: VitePress is configured with proper branding and structure, but 40+ critical pages are missing. The documentation site has solid foundations but lacks the content necessary for production use. Users cannot effectively learn or implement TypeKro due to massive content gaps.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Core Guide Documentation

**User Story:** As a new TypeKro user, I want comprehensive guides covering all deployment strategies and core concepts so that I can understand and implement TypeKro successfully in my projects.

3. WHEN core concept guides exist THEN they SHALL explain Resource Graphs, Status Hydration, Cross-Resource References, and CEL Expressions with working examples
4. WHEN guide content is written THEN it SHALL include step-by-step instructions, code examples, and clear explanations of concepts
5. WHEN guides are complete THEN they SHALL follow progressive disclosure from basic to advanced topics
6. WHEN code examples are provided THEN they SHALL be tested against the current TypeKro codebase and guaranteed to work

**Priority**: ⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL - New users cannot onboard without complete guides

2. WHEN navigation is enhanced THEN it SHALL include working search functionality that covers all content
3. WHEN code examples are displayed THEN they SHALL have syntax highlighting and proper formatting
4. WHEN the documentation site is accessed THEN it SHALL be mobile-responsive and accessible
5. WHEN interactive elements are added THEN they SHALL include expandable sections, tabbed content, and smooth navigation
6. WHEN search functionality is implemented THEN it SHALL provide relevant results with proper content indexing

**Priority**: ⭐⭐ HIGH - Interactive features significantly improve user experience

### Requirement 5: Content Quality and Accuracy

**User Story:** As a TypeKro user following documentation, I want all content to be accurate and up-to-date so that I can trust the documentation and successfully implement the examples.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is reviewed for accuracy THEN all code examples SHALL be validated against the current TypeKro codebase
