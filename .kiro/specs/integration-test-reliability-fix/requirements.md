# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The integration test suite is experiencing reliability issues with namespace management, cluster connections, and test isolation. Tests are failing with 404 errors for namespaces and HTTP request failures, indicating problems with the test infrastructure rather than the core functionality. This feature will fix the integration test reliability by addressing namespace lifecycle management, cluster connection consistency, and test isolation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Consistent Kubernetes Client Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer running integration tests, I want consistent Kubernetes client configuration so that tests don't fail due to client setup issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests run THEN the Kubernetes client configuration SHALL use the standard makeApiClient approach without monkey-patching
2. WHEN @kubernetes/client-node version 0.20.0 is used THEN the client setup SHALL work without custom workarounds
3. WHEN TLS verification is disabled for test environments THEN it SHALL be configured consistently across all test clients
4. WHEN authentication is required THEN it SHALL be handled through the standard KubeConfig mechanisms

### Requirement 2: Reliable Namespace Management

**User Story:** As a developer running integration tests, I want reliable namespace creation and cleanup so that tests don't fail due to namespace conflicts or missing namespaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test starts THEN it SHALL create a unique namespace that doesn't conflict with other tests
2. WHEN a test completes THEN it SHALL clean up its namespace regardless of test success or failure
3. WHEN namespace creation fails THEN the test SHALL provide clear error messages about cluster availability
4. WHEN multiple tests run concurrently THEN each test SHALL have its own isolated namespace
5. WHEN a test retries THEN it SHALL use a fresh namespace to avoid conflicts

### Requirement 3: Robust Cluster Connection Handling

**User Story:** As a developer running integration tests, I want robust cluster connection handling so that temporary network issues don't cause test failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cluster connection fails THEN tests SHALL retry with exponential backoff
2. WHEN cluster is not available THEN tests SHALL skip gracefully with clear messaging
3. WHEN TLS certificate issues occur THEN tests SHALL handle them appropriately for test environments
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN tests SHALL provide clear error messages about cluster setup

### Requirement 4: Test Isolation and Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer running integration tests, I want proper test isolation and cleanup so that tests don't interfere with each other.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run in parallel THEN they SHALL not interfere with each other's resources
2. WHEN a test fails THEN it SHALL still clean up its resources to avoid affecting other tests
3. WHEN tests create Kubernetes resources THEN they SHALL be properly labeled for identification and cleanup
4. WHEN the test suite completes THEN all test resources SHALL be cleaned up automatically

### Requirement 5: Improved Error Handling and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a developer debugging failing integration tests, I want clear error messages and diagnostics so that I can quickly identify and fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cluster setup fails THEN error messages SHALL include specific steps to resolve the issue
2. WHEN namespace operations fail THEN error messages SHALL include the namespace name and operation details
3. WHEN resource deployment fails THEN error messages SHALL include resource type, name, and failure reason
4. WHEN tests are skipped due to cluster unavailability THEN the reason SHALL be clearly logged

### Requirement 6: Consistent Test Environment Setup

**User Story:** As a developer setting up the test environment, I want consistent and reliable test environment setup so that integration tests work reliably across different machines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the e2e-setup script runs THEN it SHALL create a consistent test environment
2. WHEN the test cluster is created THEN it SHALL be properly configured for TypeKro testing
3. WHEN test dependencies are missing THEN setup SHALL provide clear installation instructions
4. WHEN setup completes THEN all required components SHALL be verified as working
