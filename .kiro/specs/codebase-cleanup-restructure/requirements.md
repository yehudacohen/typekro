# Codebase Cleanup and Restructure Requirements

## Introduction

This feature focuses on cleaning up the TypeKro codebase by implementing TypeScript linting, removing unused code, improving code organization, and adding better structure to support maintainability and developer experience. The goal is to establish a clean, well-organized foundation that follows best practices and is easy to navigate.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: TypeScript Linting Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated linting to catch code quality issues and enforce consistent coding standards, so that the codebase remains clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the linter THEN it SHALL identify unused imports, variables, and functions
2. WHEN I run the linter THEN it SHALL enforce consistent code formatting and style
3. WHEN I run the linter THEN it SHALL catch potential TypeScript issues and anti-patterns
4. WHEN I run the linter THEN it SHALL integrate with the existing bun-based build system
5. WHEN I run the linter THEN it SHALL provide actionable feedback for code improvements
6. WHEN I commit code THEN the linter SHALL run automatically to prevent quality regressions

### Requirement 2: Dead Code Elimination

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want to remove unused code and deprecated functions, so that the codebase is lean and focused on active functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I analyze the codebase THEN unused imports SHALL be identified and removed
2. WHEN I analyze the codebase THEN unused functions and variables SHALL be identified and removed
3. WHEN I analyze the codebase THEN deprecated methods SHALL be identified for removal or replacement
4. WHEN I remove dead code THEN all tests SHALL continue to pass
5. WHEN I remove dead code THEN no breaking changes SHALL be introduced to the public API

### Requirement 3: Code Organization and Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-organized codebase with clear separation of concerns, so that I can easily find and modify relevant code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I look at the src/core directory THEN related functionality SHALL be grouped into logical subdirectories
2. WHEN I look at the codebase THEN deployment-related code SHALL be in a dedicated module
3. WHEN I look at the codebase THEN serialization-related code SHALL be in a dedicated module
4. WHEN I look at the codebase THEN reference resolution code SHALL be in a dedicated module
5. WHEN I look at the codebase THEN type definitions SHALL be organized by domain
6. WHEN I look at the codebase THEN factory functions SHALL be organized by resource type and ecosystem
7. WHEN I navigate the codebase THEN the directory structure SHALL be intuitive and self-documenting
8. WHEN I look at factory organization THEN it SHALL support future expansion to non-Kubernetes ecosystems

### Requirement 4: Import and Export Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean and consistent import/export patterns, so that module dependencies are clear and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I look at import statements THEN they SHALL be organized and consistently formatted
2. WHEN I look at export statements THEN they SHALL follow a consistent pattern
3. WHEN I look at module boundaries THEN circular dependencies SHALL be eliminated
4. WHEN I look at type imports THEN they SHALL use proper type-only imports where applicable
5. WHEN I look at re-exports THEN they SHALL be organized in logical index files

### Requirement 5: Documentation and Comments

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and comments, so that I can understand the codebase and contribute effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I look at complex functions THEN they SHALL have clear JSDoc comments
2. WHEN I look at type definitions THEN they SHALL have descriptive comments explaining their purpose
3. WHEN I look at the codebase THEN outdated comments SHALL be updated or removed
4. WHEN I look at public APIs THEN they SHALL have comprehensive documentation
5. WHEN I look at the README THEN it SHALL reflect the current codebase structure

### Requirement 6: Performance and Bundle Size Optimization

**User Story:** As a user of TypeKro, I want optimal performance and minimal bundle size, so that my development experience is fast and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I analyze the bundle THEN unused dependencies SHALL be identified and removed
2. WHEN I analyze the code THEN performance bottlenecks SHALL be identified and addressed
3. WHEN I analyze imports THEN tree-shaking opportunities SHALL be maximized
4. WHEN I build the project THEN the bundle size SHALL be optimized
5. WHEN I run tests THEN they SHALL execute efficiently without unnecessary overhead

### Requirement 7: Build System and Tooling Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integrated tooling that works seamlessly with bun, so that my development workflow is smooth and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run bun scripts THEN linting SHALL be integrated into the build process
2. WHEN I run bun scripts THEN code formatting SHALL be automated
3. WHEN I run bun scripts THEN type checking SHALL be comprehensive and fast
4. WHEN I set up the development environment THEN all tools SHALL work together without conflicts
5. WHEN I run CI/CD pipelines THEN all quality checks SHALL pass consistently

### Requirement 8: Backward Compatibility Preservation

**User Story:** As a user of TypeKro, I want all existing functionality to continue working, so that my code doesn't break during the cleanup process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN all existing tests SHALL pass without modification
2. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN the public API SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN existing examples and documentation SHALL continue to work
4. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN performance SHALL be maintained or improved
5. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN no breaking changes SHALL be introduced
