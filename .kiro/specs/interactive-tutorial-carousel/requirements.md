# Interactive Tutorial Carousel - Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform the current static "View Examples" section into an interactive tutorial carousel that guides users through the complete TypeKro workflow. This carousel will take users on a journey from defining types to deploying applications, showcasing all deployment strategies and integration options.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Interactive Tutorial Carousel

**User Story:** As a developer visiting the TypeKro documentation site, I want to experience an interactive tutorial that walks me through the complete TypeKro workflow, so that I can understand how to use TypeKro for my own projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN the carousel loads THEN the system SHALL show step 1 of 6 with navigation controls
3. WHEN a user navigates between steps THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition between tutorial sections
4. WHEN a user reaches any step THEN the system SHALL display relevant code examples and explanations
5. WHEN a user completes the tutorial THEN the system SHALL provide clear next steps and links to detailed documentation

### Requirement 2: Step 1 - Define ArkType Schemas

**User Story:** As a developer learning TypeKro, I want to understand how to define my application schema using ArkType, so that I can create type-safe infrastructure definitions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing step 1 THEN the system SHALL show ArkType schema definition examples
2. WHEN viewing step 1 THEN the system SHALL explain the benefits of type-safe infrastructure
3. WHEN viewing step 1 THEN the system SHALL show both spec and status schema definitions
4. WHEN viewing step 1 THEN the system SHALL highlight TypeScript intellisense benefits

### Requirement 3: Step 2 - Build Resource Graph

**User Story:** As a developer learning TypeKro, I want to see how to build a resource graph using factory functions, so that I can understand how to compose Kubernetes resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing step 2 THEN the system SHALL show toResourceGraph function usage
2. WHEN viewing step 2 THEN the system SHALL demonstrate factory function composition
3. WHEN viewing step 2 THEN the system SHALL show cross-resource references
4. WHEN viewing step 2 THEN the system SHALL explain the builder pattern benefits

### Requirement 4: Step 3 - YAML Generation (GitOps Path)

**User Story:** As a developer using GitOps workflows, I want to see how to generate YAML from my TypeKro definitions, so that I can integrate with my existing CI/CD pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing step 3 THEN the system SHALL show YAML generation examples
2. WHEN viewing step 3 THEN the system SHALL demonstrate serializeResourceGraphToYaml usage
3. WHEN viewing step 3 THEN the system SHALL show the generated Kubernetes manifests
4. WHEN viewing step 3 THEN the system SHALL explain GitOps integration benefits

### Requirement 5: Step 4 - Direct Factory Deployment

**User Story:** As a developer wanting immediate deployment, I want to see how to use direct factories to deploy resources, so that I can deploy directly to Kubernetes without additional tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing step 4 THEN the system SHALL show DirectResourceFactory usage
2. WHEN viewing step 4 THEN the system SHALL demonstrate kubectl-free deployment
3. WHEN viewing step 4 THEN the system SHALL show dependency resolution in action
4. WHEN viewing step 4 THEN the system SHALL explain when to use direct deployment

### Requirement 6: Step 5 - KRO Controller Deployment

**User Story:** As a developer wanting advanced Kubernetes patterns, I want to see how to use KRO controller deployment, so that I can leverage custom resource definitions and operators.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing step 5 THEN the system SHALL show KroResourceFactory usage
2. WHEN viewing step 5 THEN the system SHALL demonstrate ResourceGraphDefinition creation
3. WHEN viewing step 5 THEN the system SHALL show KRO controller installation steps
4. WHEN viewing step 5 THEN the system SHALL explain operator pattern benefits

### Requirement 7: Step 6 - Alchemy Integration

**User Story:** As a developer using Alchemy for resource management, I want to see how to integrate TypeKro with Alchemy, so that I can leverage advanced resource lifecycle management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing step 6 THEN the system SHALL show Alchemy integration examples
2. WHEN viewing step 6 THEN the system SHALL demonstrate resource registration patterns
3. WHEN viewing step 6 THEN the system SHALL show advanced deployment strategies
4. WHEN viewing step 6 THEN the system SHALL explain Alchemy benefits and use cases

### Requirement 8: Responsive Carousel Design

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the tutorial carousel to work seamlessly across desktop and mobile, so that I can learn TypeKro regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN the system SHALL display a full-featured carousel with side-by-side code and explanation
2. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN the system SHALL adapt to a stacked layout with touch navigation
3. WHEN navigating on any device THEN the system SHALL provide intuitive controls (arrows, dots, swipe)
4. WHEN viewing code examples THEN the system SHALL ensure proper syntax highlighting and readability

### Requirement 9: Progressive Disclosure

**User Story:** As a developer learning TypeKro, I want to see information revealed progressively, so that I'm not overwhelmed and can focus on one concept at a time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any step THEN the system SHALL show only relevant information for that step
2. WHEN advancing steps THEN the system SHALL build upon previous concepts
3. WHEN viewing code examples THEN the system SHALL highlight new additions or changes
4. WHEN completing the tutorial THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of the complete workflow

### Requirement 10: Call-to-Action Integration

**User Story:** As a developer who completed the tutorial, I want clear next steps and links to detailed documentation, so that I can start implementing TypeKro in my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN completing the tutorial THEN the system SHALL show "Get Started" and "View Full Documentation" buttons
2. WHEN clicking "Get Started" THEN the system SHALL navigate to the getting started guide
3. WHEN clicking specific deployment strategy examples THEN the system SHALL link to relevant detailed guides
4. WHEN viewing any step THEN the system SHALL provide "Learn More" links for deeper exploration
