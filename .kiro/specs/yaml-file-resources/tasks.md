### üìä **Overall Progress: 75% Complete**
- **High-quality foundation** with excellent closure-based architecture
- **All core YAML functionality working** with proper TypeKro integration
- **Main gaps**: Bootstrap compositions, type fixes, comprehensive testing

---

## üö® **Immediate Action Items (Required to Unblock)**

### 1. **Fix TypeScript Compilation** (5 minutes) - CRITICAL
- **Issue**: `KustomizationSpec` and `KustomizationStatus` missing from `src/core/types/yaml.ts`
- **Impact**: Prevents build and all subsequent development
- **Action**: Add missing type definitions and exports

### 2. **Investigate Skipped Integration Tests** (15 minutes) - HIGH
- **Issue**: Helm integration tests are disabled, not running end-to-end validation
- **Impact**: Cannot verify YAML closures work with real Kubernetes
- **Action**: Determine why tests are skipped and re-enable them

### 3. **Implement Kro Mode Support** (30 minutes) - HIGH
- **Issue**: Task 3.6 not implemented, Kro mode YAML support missing
- **Impact**: YAML resources only work in Direct mode
- **Action**: Add Kro factory closure validation and execution

### 4. **Create Bootstrap Compositions** (45 minutes) - MEDIUM
- **Issue**: No pre-built compositions for TypeKro runtime bootstrap
- **Impact**: Users cannot easily deploy complete GitOps platform
- **Action**: Implement `typeKroRuntimeBootstrap()` and examples
